// Problem Statement: Given a list of folder paths, remove all subfolders so that only the top-level folders remain.
// Approach: Sort the folder paths and use prefix comparison to skip nested subfolders.

// Step-by-step Procedure:
// 1. Sort the input folder paths lexicographically to ensure subfolders appear immediately after their parent.
// 2. Initialize the result vector `ans` with the first folder path.
// 3. Iterate through the sorted folder list from index 1 onwards.
// 4. For each folder, check if it starts with the last added folder in `ans` followed by a '/'.
// 5. If not, itâ€™s not a subfolder and should be added to the result.

// Time Complexity: O(n * m * log n), where n is number of folders and m is average folder length.
// Space Complexity: O(n * m), to store the output folder list.
